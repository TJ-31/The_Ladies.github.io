									<hr class="major" />
										<h2>What kind of work is done?</h2>

									<p>In general, an IT Sales professional is a trusted client advisor who brings companies the solutions they need and helps transform companies with innovative industry and technical solutions. I work in Commercial and the Public Sector within IBM Services. 
										In this role, we help our clients envision the future by offering IT services such as Cloud services, Networking, End user support, Managed Services and end-to-end IT and business process services. </p>
										
										<h3>About the industry: Public Sector.</h3>
										<p>The industry I work in is the Public Sector. 
										This industry involves working with Victorian State Government departments consisting of Education, Human Services, Justice, Police, Treasury and Finance, Premier and Cabinet, Transport, Environment Land and Water, Jobs and Precincts and Public Hospitals.</p>
										
									<h3>What other kinds of work do you have to do? </h3>
									<p>Other than selling and encouraging clients to purchase our services, I develop relationships with both clients and people in external businesses and organisations to further enhance the position of IBM Services within the market in order to win new business. </p>
										<p><b>Some other tasks include:</b>
										<li>Lead teams to provide ongoing direction to design new solutions integrating products and services bringing innovation to the industry supported. </li>
										<li>Direct resource teams to ensure appropriate technical/services resources are deployed. </li>
										<li>Meet contract negotiations and signings targets, profit and revenue measures, manage expense budgets.</li>
										<li>Understand the competitive strategies, customer competitors, differentiators and the framework within which an industry operates.</li></p>
									
									<hr class="major" />
									<h2>What kinds of people does an IT Sales Professional interact with?</h2>
									<p>The kinds of people that I work and interact with are the customers from different industries such as government, finance, retail, telecommunications, energy and utilities. 
										These people consist of: CFO, CIO, CEO, Application Managers, Infrastructure Managers, Networking Managers, Cloud professionals , Project Managers, Security professionals.</p>
									
									<h3>Please tell us about your interactions with other IT professionals. </h3>
									<p>Within my organisation I work in large teams with different skillsets to create solutions to bring to industry and clients. I will lead a team to come up with a response to a tender for a government client. 
										This process involves engaging with a Technical Solution Manager (TSM) that will design the end to end solution for a particular opportunity. The TSM will engage all the required competencies to build a solution. This often consists of Cloud Subject Matter Expert (SME), Networking SME’s, Managed Services SME’s, Security SME’s and others. 
										Together this group will work in collaboration to design a solution and provide the costs. The cost of the solution is then managed by a Pricing resource. 
										My responsibility is to work with the pre-sales team to ensure the solution meets client requirements, is competitively priced and has a strong and compelling value proposition. </p>
									
										<h3>What about your interactions with clients or investors? </h3>
										<p>Within my job as an IT Sales Professional, I interact with many IT clients everyday.
											Whether I am advising to a Chief Information Officer regarding their digital transformation journey or working with a Network specialist to help design a new network to enable wireless connectivity, it is important to have strong communicational skills to ensure you are able to have these types of conversations and bring value to a client to help them achieve their outcomes.
											Effective partnerships with clients are required to be established and maintained that will help with contract negotiations, lasting agreements and contractual commitments. </p>
										
											<hr class="major" />
									<h2>What aspects of your work do you spend most time on? Please tell us about these. </h2>
									<p>As an IT sales professional, I spent the most time meeting with clients to sell IBM’s services. 
										This involves mainly face-to-face meetings or now due to COVID, we spend a lot of time doing video conferences on Webex.
										Face to face meetings are crucial as we can identify new sales opportunities, discuss proposals, negotiate contracts and provide presentations.
						In addition, we spend a lot of time on producing concise and accurate written communication to clearly convey thoughts and ideas to clients and establish and maintain positive working relationships with peers and the management team.</p>
									
										<hr class="major" />
										<h2>How did the COVID pandemic effect the performance of your job as a Sales Professional?</h2>
										<span class="image right"><img src="images/covid.png" alt="" /></span>
									<p>The performance of my job was affected in many ways. From having daily face to face meetings with clients at an office and also with IBM colleagues, this quickly changed to meetings over Cisco Webex, Microsoft Teams or other video platforms.
										Clients began to delay or cancel many new projects in flight as there was uncertainty for the future. With people working from home as the new ‘norm’, IBM quickly developed new solutions to bring to its clients to address challenges for organisations and governments to operate in an effective and efficient way.
										As a sales professional I started to engage in new customer conversations with executives to offer a set of initiatives and solutions to ensure companies adapt to what was going to be a new, different kind of normal. </p>
										<p><b>The imperatives addressed the following:</b>
											<li>Empowering the remote workforce</li>
											<li>Engaging customers virtually</li>
											<li>Remote access to everything</li>
											<li>Accelerate agility and efficiency</li>
											<li>Protection against new cybersecurity risks</li>
											<li>Supporting health providers and government services</li>
										</p>

									<h2>Example of the work you do that best captures the essence of the IT industry?</h2>
									<p> An example of work that best captures the essence of the IT industry is a project that I worked on involving the Department of Education and Training (DET).
										The project consisted of helping the DET to perform planning, design and deployment services for a high capacity, enterprise wireless and collaboration network.
										This would provide access to digital learning resources and systems for school staff and students. 
										The collaboration and wireless network supports their ICT program across 1600 schools across Victoria.
										The solution proposed was the design, warehousing, staging, multi-supplier management and installation of a Wireless LAN, Smartboards and Webex Teams solution with an adoption plan to support teachers in the use of their technology enabling virtual classrooms.
										This project that we recently worked on best demonstrates the essence of the IT industry, implementing IT strategy and technology to further improve the education department.</p>
