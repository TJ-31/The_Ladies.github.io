												<p>In our group we have 5 members where 4 of them plan to become a cyber security analyst and one of them wants to become a web developer. Both of our career plans are in high demand and offer a surplus of job opportunities. Our career plans both require us to have similar skills like CSS, JavaScript and HTML. This means that even if we change our career plan in the future we will still be able to apply our current skills to another field as these skills are transferable. Both career plans require a minimum 3 to 5 years of experience, which means that before we get to our desired profession we need to get into entry level jobs and internships.</p>
										<p>Web developers and cybersecurity analysts focus on different areas in technology. Cyber security analysts mainly focus on protecting clients from cyber attacks whereas web developers create and produce an online platform for clients and businesses. Although both of these career plans have a high demand in the IT industry, they have different average incomes. Cyber security analysts earn an average income of $76k whereas web developers earn an average income of $62k. </p>
