									<h2>Individual Reflections</h2>
									<h3>Isabella:</h3>
									<p>
										As a group, I think we worked very well together. We all collaborated effectively both online and in class and whenever a group member needed help or assistance, someone was always there to provide a solution. One thing that could have been improved was organising more meetings on Microsoft Teams to verbally discuss our assignment as we only saw each other once a week during tutorial times. However, this was hard to achieve as everyone had different personal and work schedules, making it hard to find a time where every group member was available for a meeting. A thing that I found surprising was how efficient each team member was in getting their work done. Nobody brought down the team and everyone completed their sections all on time. I have learnt that each person has different strengths and weaknesses and the best way to allocate tasks is to ensure everyone was comfortable with their designated section so that it was achieved at a high standard and completely efficiently.

									<h3>Sanushka:</h3>
									<p>
										I think our group was able to collaborate well and complete our individual tasks. We were able to ask for help if we had any errors or confusions, so everyone remained on the same page. No one was pushed to take too much workload nor was anyone avoiding any responsibilities. Our communication skills were strong throughout the process, so everyone was clear with what tasks needed to be completed. The only thing that would need to be improved is collaborating more in person or in online meetings, although a lot of tasks required us to divide it and work individually, we could still try to do some tasks together so that everyone is happy with the outcome. One thing that was surprising is that we all were able to click well despite having so many group members. We all had similar thought processes and were always on the same page. One thing I learnt about groups is that it is important to have clear communication with all group members in order to get a task done quicker.

									<h3>Ella:</h3>
									<p>As a group we were able to communicate well and divide the working load to ensure everyone does their part and that it all gets done on time. Our team meeting allowed us to all discuss any problems or solve something that we had forgotten, which was always solved by everybody. We were able to communicate throughout the whole milestone allowing everyone to know exactly what was asked of them and to check in if anyone needed help. With our designated pages we were able to set dates we wanted them done by to ensure if there were problems before submission we had plenty of time to solve them. We made sure everyone was comfortable with what they were doing and ensured we could all do our part of the milestone equally and to the best of our abilities. It was great to be able to see our team profile, to see how everyone learns and how we can involve everyone. I found that although two of us were high percentage of extroversion that we made sure to not take over discussions and listen to those that aren’t as out there and give them a chance to share their opinion. Overall everyone contributed their part and all communicated well in order for everything to be done successfully and to the best of our abilities.

									<h3>Sahana:</h3>
									<p>Overall our group was able to delegate tasks among group members and complete them on time. We worked well together in meetings as well as in person and we also took the time to seek feedback and make corrections to our assignment. One thing that we could have done better is that we could have scheduled meetings starting from week 5. We delayed our group meetings which caused us to cram several sessions into a short span of time, often causing some disruptions to our own schedules. In the future, we will ensure that we set a better timeline outlining when we will be consulting with our group members. One thing that was surprising was that despite our varying and in some cases similar personalities, we were able to work together and complete all the tasks required in an efficient manner. Each person used their individual strengths to help those around them which significantly decreased the hurdles that we faced during this group project. One thing that I have learned about group work is that good communication and consistency in completing work can have a good impact as it can increase the overall productivity of the group.

									<h3>Trisha:</h3>
									<p>In our group all the members have participated equally where each one of us took part in at least 1 or more sections in the assignment, which enabled the group website to be completed successfully. When performing our tasks, the members were able to positively reach out for help and were allowed to ask for help without having any communication issues and as a result we were able to solve any technical issues with ease. There was only one problem in our group which was having weekly meetings on the MS Team. Firstly, if it was really hard to schedule a meeting because our availability times did not match, hence why we couldn’t have enough meetings. Secondly, since we all meet weekly once, we almost discuss what we need to do and what we have done on that day which made it really hard to find a topic that we can discuss in our meetings. Therefore, in my opinion this is the area where we could improve on in our future assignments where we will be able to make time that suits everyone else in the group in order to make adequate meetings. Since this is my first year in university and I don’t know anyone, I thought it would be really hard to find my group members for assignments, however, when we attended our first class we unknowingly got to know each other and formed a group. I was surprised at the fact that each one of us worked efficiently and really hard together for the assignment because it would normally be really hard to collaborate and work together in a group especially if you don’t know them really well. Despite all this, our group members were really positive in both communication and participation. Consequently, I learned that with a positive and helpful attitude, it is really easy to communicate with each other which allowed me to work efficiently and effectively.

									<h2>Group Reflection</h2>
									<p>
										The group was able to distribute tasks evenly and everyone completed their tasks on time. Everyone in the group contributed whether that be suggestions for improvement or helping each other. One thing that could’ve been improved was sticking to the timeline a bit more closely so that we would be ahead and able to have time to fix up issues and polish off our work. As a team everyone put in and surprised us in their own ways, Isabella really took on the leadership role and led the group through practical classes and ensured everything was done when it needed to be to ensure we’d finish before the due date. Trisha shocked us with her amazing organisational skills guaranteeing all meetings were scheduled and everyone was available. She also really took initiative by emailing the teacher to ask questions we were unsure of on how many meetings were needed. Sahana really surprised us when we found out our feedback from assignment one and her project idea had a few privacy issues but within an hour she had completely solved the issue. Similarly, Ella amazed us at how fast she was able to do her sections, we had discussed making sure we had written our IT technologies section within 5 days but in 1 day she had finalized it, making her able to move onto other tasks efficiently. Sanushka surprised us as through our meeting she always had all the information and requirements needed for the project making it easy if someone needed clarification on a section. Her resourcefulness helped clear up any confusion and also ensure nothing was missing from the report.
