                                        </header>
										<p>Hi, my name is Ella Smith and I’m currently studying at RMIT in my first year completing my bachelor of information technology. I was born in Australia however many generations ago my family came from England. Outside of studying I love to play netball and football, I’ve played netball for 8 years but only recently started playing football this year. I discovered my interest in Information Technology when I began a Year 11 Computing accelerated class in Year 10. Which is my experience through Information Technology and then further completing Year 12 Informatics in Year 11. It led to the GoGirl excursion that sparked my interest in IT as it gave me an insight on what I could do in the IT field to help inspire other people. My main interest in it is cybersecurity as it’s growing bigger and bigger in our society and I want to help others protect their online data and information.</p>

											<h3>Sanushka Das</h3>
										<h4>Student number: s3906181</h4>
                                        </header>
										<p>Hello, my name is Sanushka Das (but you can call me Shan if that is too hard!). I am a first year student studying a Bachelor of Information Technology. I am Indian however I was born in Oman and came to Australia when I was 4. When I first came here I was speaking a mix of three languages Hindi, Malayalam and English, which inevitably made it difficult to communicate with my peers at school. Quickly over time my English improved, however I became less fluent in other languages. 
										My interest in IT took some time to develop unlike many people who have a profound love for tech from a young age. I only noticed very recently that I have enjoyed using technology throughout my life in non-obvious ways. To begin with I enjoyed exploring the more artistic side of IT like animation and games development. This was more of a hobby and I didn’t really take it too seriously. In my spare time I also loved watching people animate or code on twitch. But more recently I have been looking more into cyber security. My interest in cybersecurity stems from wanting to help people protect their sensitive information and allow them to use the internet freely without their information being compromised. Some other hobbies that I have include: painting, volleyball and dance. </p>

										<p>Hi, my name is Sahana Sukumar (s3897992) and I am a first year student completing my Bachelor of IT at RMIT. My nationality is Indian and I speak Marathi at home. My hobbies include reading, drawing, listening to music, watching sci-fi and thriller movies and my favorite sports are Netball and swimming. During year 10, I took part in a semester of Robotics and Digital Technology where I learnt some html and basic css as well as how to program a Lego Mindstorms battle bot. My main interests in IT include AI and Cybersecurity. I have a keen interest in AI as it is complex, applicable to a wide range of industries and it is a relatively new field which leaves much room for creativity and problem solving. I look forward to learning more about Cybersecurity as it is in high demand, has a wide range of global opportunities and it is rewarding in terms of the positive impact that it can have on businesses or individuals.</p>

                                        </header>
										<p>Hello, my name is Isabella Modica and I am completing my final year at RMIT studying a Bachelor of Business (Information Systems). My cultural background is Italian, I was born in Australia but my grandparents were all born in Italy and migrated here. In my spare time I like to keep fit and exercise by either or watch a tv series or movie on Netflix. My passion and interest in IT has originated from my dad, who works as an IT Sales Executive at IBM. He has always encouraged me to pursue a career in information technology as it is a growing industry. At high school, in year 10, I did my work experience at IBM. During this week I was exposed to many innovative projects such and was so intrigued that from this day onwards, I knew I wanted to pursue a career within the IT industry. My main interest is to eventually pursue a career in cybersecurity to protect users data and privacy online.</p>

										<p>Hi, my name is Trisha Jangam (s3900371). I am a current student at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Melbourne, where I am undertaking an undergraduate degree — ‘Bachelor in Information Technology’ and this is my first year. My nationality is Indian and I speak Telugu at home. Ever since I was a kid, I had a passion to learn and gain knowledge about technology. In these past years, there were various and numerous technological developments that have taken place and introduced many new outcomes to the world. Technology has never failed to surprise me with its creative innovations, hence it led me to gain interest in the IT industry. Every time I use or see tech devices it makes me want to find out more about technology developments and how they make it work the way they do. Furthermore, some of my hobbies and interests are listening to music, workout/gym, playing basketball, snookers as well as a few video games.</p>

<h4>Overall impact that the results may have on teamwork</h4>
<p>Throughout our group we are all high in the agreeable section which will impact our results on teamwork as it will help to decide on ideas and allow everyone to feel comfortable to share suggestions. With Isabella and Ella having high percentages of extroversion this could cause them to be loud and speak over other group members which is where they will need to be aware of this and be cautious about taking over. However Sahana’s openness will help impact on the teamwork as she will be able to honestly tell them if they are too loud or speaking over other members. </p>
