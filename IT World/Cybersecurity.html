				<p style="font-size: 20px; color: black; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Cybersecurity refers to the processes and performances of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. It guards information and data from cyberattacks trying to steal or change it. To have a cybersecurity system implemented can protect information systems from threats. The goal is to protect digital information from those who want to use it for wrong and dangerous reasons. Not only businesses but individuals require cybersecurity plans and systems to ensure they are safe online. It is essential to also prevent attacks that aim to ruin a system's operations. Such a big portion of data is sensitive and confidential therefore the importance of cybersecurity grows with the volume of cyber attacks. Cyber security is a massive field and covers so many sections including network security, physical security, cloud security, end-user education, critical infrastructure security, operation security, disaster recovery, data security and application security.<br/><br>It’s a massive challenge to keep up with the changing security risks but it is essential and needs to be proactive and adaptive. It is recommended to always monitor your systems and real-time assessments to defend threats. Cybersecurity has many benefits but the most important ones are to protect against networks and data as well as prevention from unauthorised user access. In the ongoing increase in technology, cybersecurity comes with it too. Soon we'll be seeing security systems updating rapidly ensuring no time for attacks to step in while defenses are down. As well as systems taking decisions in real time and that can connect to shared intelligence centres to keep data protected at all times. Cloud providers such as microsoft and google have inputted higher levels of security which will continue to increase. At the basics of cybersecurity in today's society companies are having issues protecting the cloud, implementing strong password protocols and keeping databases secure however in the hopes of the future artificial intelligence will fix this. <br/><br>Artificial Intelligence makes cybersecurity possible as it helps by predicting behaviours and being able to block them out. The more artificial intelligence develops the more cybersecurity will too as they very closely cross over. Blockchaining will also help cybersecurity grow as if applied currently it may be very impactful to the future of cybersecurity. By making sure a user cannot perform an action and then later deny performing the action could be the change and most important process of cybersecurity. Creating it to be much resistant and firm for hackers allowing organisations data to be safe. The advancement in cybersecurity will be aided by quantum as it will drive scientific discoveries, inventions and things not possible in currenting computing. Continuing to introduce new security features by challenging industry encryption advice. The future of cybersecurity will revolve around understanding how our data works and where it really is, as the importance of data will grow every year. As the cybersecurity industry grows we need to ensure we develop workers for that industry as if there's a shortage it leaves attackers opportunities to break down weaker defences.</p>

								  <h2 style="color: black;">Impact</h2>
								  <p style="font-size: 20px; color: black; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">It will impact many businesses and individuals as with cybersecurity implemented it will hopefully eliminate attacks. Meaning the significant financial loss and theft won’t be existent or a threat. If attacks are frequent due to the cybersecurity not being effective this will lead to loss of business for companies as customers need to feel their information is protected from danger. In result to strong cybersecurity plans and systems it will impact businesses ensuring they can not only keep their systems safe but their customers. Individuals will feel safe to go online knowing they are safe from threats allowing them to not have a mental strain that they’re data may not be safe. <br/><br>This will massively change jobs as those who are employed to store files may completely go from physical files to online. Allowing their jobs to be much easier and efficient if the data is stored safely. Most people affected will be those who deal with storing data and information daily in their jobs. If cybersecurity is successful it will allow them to safely store it allowing individuals and businesses to successfully protect it. <br/><br>However because cybersecurity is becoming such a big priority in businesses and individuals when it is breached it can completely ruin them. This will make many current jobs made redundant as the growth in cybersecurity will have a growth in online technologies. Leading to many jobs not needed anymore because it is easy to find files online so there isn’t anyone needed to take, print and sort files as online applications do that for us. However it will create more jobs as cybersecurity requires a lot of different things to ensure it works as well as it should. Although more jobs will be created they may replace positions with staff who can implement cybersecurity and guarantee it is successful.</p>

								  <h2 style="color: black;">Affect</h2>
								  <p style="font-size: 20px; color: black; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">This will affect me in my daily life as the development of cybersecurity will allow me to feel safe on the internet. It will enable me to have my information and data protected as well as others, changing lives. The more this industry develops the more likely the threats will not successfully gain access to information from individuals and businesses. Leaving more and more people able to feel safe online this would allow me to not have the fear that my information is being shared. <br/><br>The loss of jobs will not affect me as the job I currently work does not involve cybersecurity however once I finish my degree.This will be different for me as I grow older once I begin a job that requires information and data stored electronically. As the cybersecurity industry develops I will be able to trust the internet. However it will be different in that more and more information technology systems will be created due to the protection of cybersecurity. Changing the ways I live as many jobs will be let go of or changed meaning family members and friends unemployed. <br/><br>This will affect members of my family as for many they have to store files for work but unfortunately they do not feel that the online systems are safe enough to secure information. However with cybersecurity constantly developing in the next few years once the rate of successful threats are reduced they will be able to confidently store their data online. This will dramatically affect their daily lives as it is more time efficient and easily accessible. Resulting in more time to do other tasks and not having to go through hundreds of paper files to find the right one.</p>
