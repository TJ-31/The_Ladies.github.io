									<h2><b>What do they do? </b></h2>
									<p style="font-size: 20px; color: black; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"><br>Robots have managed to be successfully integrated into many industries including defence, space exploration and healthcare.
									<br>
									<br><b>Military: </b>
									<br>
									<br>In the military, there have been many modifications to the way that tanks and fighter aircrafts are being used. A company by the name of "Rime Metal" has introduced a group of robotic tanks called the "Wolf Pack." These robots operate using robot swarm technology and use camera systems to detect objects in their surroundings. The Wolf Pack works closely with their human operators who receive all the data collected by these robots and make decisions on whether to launch explosives. On the other hand, fighter aircrafts being made by a company called "Darpa" has created a system called "Air Combat Evolutions" which consists of aircrafts being able to carry out closed air combat. The user of such aircrafts will be able to access the controls through a virtual reality headset which will project the position of the aircraft as well as notify the user of any objects in its vicinity. Britain has created similar aircrafts to Darpa however they have included a stealth mode which will make them undiscoverable to their opponents as well as Artificial intelligence which will be able to control a group of slave drones  as well as communicate with other robotic aircrafts.
									<br>
									<br>Advancements in aircrafts such as minimising fuel consumption, reducing noise and supersonic technology will allow robots to perform better during trials whilst ensuring that resources are minimised. Robots may be introduced as assistants for pilots in the future wherein they will be able to communicate observations to the pilot and assist in their decision making process.
                                    <br>
									<br><b>Space Exploration:</b>
									<br>
									<br>With regards to space exploration, robots have been introduced to aid humans in unfamiliar or potentially dangerous environments. Boston Dynamics' robot dog named "Spot'' has been created to accompany astronauts to navigate harsh surfaces using visual inspection and data collection. Boston Dynamics hopes to further develop "Spot" so that it can be used to search for biosignatures, planets' geological past and to also assist in future habitation of other planets. Meanwhile in the International space Station, NASA's "Astrobee'' robotic free-flying system is being used to document experiments as well as move cargo throughout the station. This robotic system is equipped with arms which enable it to grasp objects such as handlebars as it moves to different areas of the ISS. NASA hopes that these companions will be able to work with astronauts to potentially take care of future maintenance work on the space station. Although the event of humans inhabiting another planet is quite some time away, companies such as Sarcos Robotics have begun to create exoskeletons with the name of "Guardian XO'' which enable humans to lift and move heavy items. These exoskeletons have the potential to be used for future space missions in addition to space suits, to further help astronauts work in space.
                                    <br>
									<br>Robots in this field of space exploration will need to be supported by advancements in navigation systems for extra-terrestrial locations. As we progress further into space, there may be the need for navigation systems to be installed to make it easier to locate and reach certain areas of planets. This advancement could be particularly useful for when astronauts decide to explore the far side of the moon in 2024 as navigation systems could help them to pinpoint certain locations on this darker side in order to make it easier to get around.
                                    <br>
									<br><b>Healthcare:</b>
									<br>
									<br>In the healthcare sector, robots such as the "Vicarious Robot" are being used to conduct surgeries by delivering information collected from sensors to the surgeon's VR headset which will recreate the interior of the human body for the surgeons to analyse. The versatility of this robot enables it to conduct abdominal surgeries by entering the abdomen through a smaller incision than what was previously required for such surgeries, thus minimising pain for the patient. Currently, robots are being used to check the temperature of people before they enter workplaces to ensure that they are not at risk of spreading Covid-19. These robots use facial recognition to record the data for each individual and help workplaces by minimising the number of people that may be carriers of this virus.
                                    <br>
									<br>In the near future, the health industry aims to refine their design of robotic prosthetic limbs by using more flexible material for the creation of artificial ligaments and muscles. This will enable users to have a greater range of motion and thus be able to accomplish a greater number of tasks. For this to be possible, there needs to be more research conducted regarding the lifetime of such materials and how we can minimise the possibility of them needing to be repaired several times.

									<h2>What is the likely impact?</h2>									
									<p style="font-size: 20px; color: black; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"><br>The developments in Robots have sparked debate over whether they are an opportunity or a threat to humanity. In the topic of workplaces, robots can be used in a variety of applications, whether alongside human workers or by themselves.
									<br>
									<br>Robots can be beneficial to workplaces. Their ability to work for an endless period of time means that they can generate valuable output for businesses in a timely manner. This will mean that workers who previously had tedious tasks can focus on other meaningful work, which could give them a new sense of purpose in their workplace. Furthermore, the reduction in repetitive tasks means that employees can work on bigger and more complex projects without having to worry about time and resource constraints, thus the assistance of robots could potentially increase the overall productivity of businesses by allowing them to achieve more outcomes in an efficient manner. Also, opportunities for social interaction can be maximised in the workplace which can cause an increase in employee wellbeing.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>On the other hand, granting robots a greater sense of singularity may mean that they could deprive workplaces of humans altogether. This could mean that humans will only be needed to act as supervisors who make final decisions and set deadlines for tasks. The result of such an implementation of robots could leave employees with a lack of purpose, lack of desire to improve, a diminished feeling of responsibility and overall low self-esteem.

									<br>
									<br>Whilst not all industries will be suitable for the integration of robots and not all humans may be replaced, some jobs in industries such as manufacturing, maintenance, fast food delivery, and customer service have a greater risk of being replaced entirely by robots in the near future. Industries such as defence, healthcare and space exploration may have more opportunities for humans and robots to collaborate when making important decisions therefore the likelihood of jobs being made redundant may be slightly lower.

									<h2>How will this affect you?</h2>
									<p style="font-size: 20px; color: black; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"><br> In the span of 5-10 years, robots may become more popular in large industries such as healthcare, travel, defence and space exploration, however they may not be used as personal household assistants as they may require more time to develop household skills and their price may need to be altered to suit a wider consumer base. For the most part, the only interactions that I may have with a robot may include when opting for a fast food delivery option, talking to customer service over the phone or in person and perhaps when travelling in vehicles. In my future workplace, I may need to collaborate with robots when working on projects and when working with my peers. With regards to friends and family, robots could possibly make travel much more safer and faster, hence providing more opportunities for us to meet.
									<br>
									<br>In the education sector, schools and universities may have more opportunities for students to experiment with robot kits, which would mean that future generations will be able to familiarise themselves with this technology from a young age and work towards improving it  later on.
