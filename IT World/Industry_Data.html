									<h2>Has our opinion on our Ideal Job changed after reviewing the Burning Glass Data?</h2>
									<p>
										The Burning Glass data did not influence our opinions on the ideal jobs of a web developer and cybersecurity analyst. The Burning Glass data identifies that both jobs are in demand, a web developer had 5990 job postings available between March 2017 and February 2018. The cyber analyst had 2914 job postings available between March 2017 and February 2018. This identifies that both of these occupations are in demand and have opportunities for future employment. We are very passionate about achieving our career aspirations and would love to continue to pursue being a cybersecurity analyst or web developer.
