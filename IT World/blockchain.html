									<h2>What does it do?</h2>
									<p>Block chain technology is a method of sorting and storing information into a database. Blockchain is decentralised, which means that blockchain does not store its information in one central location, it rather has the information across a large network of computers. 
										Between block chain technology is mainly used to store information as no changes can be made to the system, nor can it be hacked. The difference between a normal database and block chain technology is that information is recorded in blocks. Once one block is full of data, it chains to the previous block, leaving the data in chronological order. Block chain technology is mainly used as a digital ledger of transactions. Anything of value can be recorded safely for all involved using block chain technology. Cryptocurrency is a digital currency that is exchanged for goods and services of a company. This virtual currency is secured by cryptography. Cryptography is a method of protecting information via code. This code can only be processed and read by those who are intended to read it. This security makes it very difficult to counterfeit. Thus, there is a large attraction to this system.
										</p>
									<p> Now the pharmaceutical industry can benefit from the use of blockchain technology. Such as improving the efficiency of supply chains while keeping track of things like vaccine distribution, especially after the COVID-19 Pandemic, many errors were revealed in the supply chain system. The World Health Organisation estimates the 1 in 10 of all medical products being sold is falsified or substandard in low-income companies.
										To fix these supply chain issues, the pharmaceutical industry is now moving towards block chain technology. By using blockchain technology, there is now a faster and easier method to verify a legitimate business. Companies do not need to disclose sensitive information in order to do this. Instead, to prove for actual data mathematical proof can be given. Block chain is used to reduce the occurrence of fraud and check for authenticity. 
										</p>
									<p>Since the creation of cryptocurrency the most common use is to send and receive payments for little expense and high speed. Another popular use of cryptocurrencies is for long term benefits through a method called “staking”. The method of staking involves the process referred to as “Proof of Stake”. This process involves an individual is to prove that they have been depositing money. From this process the individual gets a return based on inflation, how many coins have been staked and many other factors. In the upcoming years, block chain technology is likely to rapidly grow. According to a trend insight report by Gartner, by 2022 at least one innovative business built by blockchain technology will be worth approximately $10 billion. It is estimated by 2026 the business value built by blockchain technology is estimated to grow over $360 billion and by 2030 it will increase to over $3.1 trillion.
                                    This technology seems to mainly grow in the cybersecurity field, as a common problem for businesses is data tampering. The amount of investors in cryptocurrency is also expected to grow in the next few years. The value of bitcoin in 2030 is predicted to go up $500k USD per bitcoin, as predicted by CEO of Morgan Creek Capital Management, Mark Yuso. As more businesses desire for safe transactions, block chain technology will continue to rise in popularity as the system is built in a way that is safer compared to other mechanisms of transaction. </p>

									<h2>What is the likely impact?</h2>
									<p>The impact of block chain technology is mostly seen in the banking sector, however it also effects businesses and other industries. The reason the banking industry is affected most is due to block chain technology being able to remove intermediary and therefore speed up usually long processes. Block chain technology allows users to pay at a faster speed and for a lower fee, this is due to the decentralisation ledger of payments. As there is no intermediary, the loan and credit industry is also more accessible to people. It is more secure to borrow money and also has lower interest rates. Since blockchain doesn’t require manual verification, many jobs can be replaced. However, this improves the level of efficiency of the work and is a more preferable option than manual verification. Some of the most effected jobs would include real estate brokers and lenders. Since the demand of these jobs will go down with this new technology, there will be more high-level skills expected from brokers or lenders. However, blockchain technology can allow more businesses to arise. Although the banking industry effects the employees, businesses can have more clients as it is more accessible for others.

									<h2>How will this affect you?</h2>
									<p>Block chain technology could affect me personally in many ways. My digital identity can be better protected with blockchain technology. I can track and manage my digital identities without disclosing any sensitive information. If there were an election to come up I could vote using blockchain technology. My vote would remain anonymous but still show that I have voted. If I wanted to exchange money with someone I could use blockchain technology using smart contracts. Smart contracts would allow to easily carry out transactions when certain requirements are met and immediately carry it out. Some more areas include healthcare, insurance, online retail and supply chain management. When looking for a loan to buy a house, my family may use cryptocurrency instead of going directly to a bank. They could do this using peer-to- peer lending. My family could borrow cryptocurrency to take out the loan. The lender will put up their own cryptocurrency to serve as a loan and earns interest that my family would have paid.
